I want to build a social media OSINT tool, without any API

I want the tool to be web based interface

i want to search a username on the plaftform and it should be able to search through all social medias available and it should scrape any information within the social medias connected with the username


i want to search specific keywords and it should be able to look through all the social medias and scrape the contents like posts, comments and likes also usernames and userids


it should scrape using my current browser because i would already be logged in and have cookies so it can use it to not get detected by captia


what do you think?
Building a Web-Based Social Media OSINT Tool
This is an ambitious but feasible project. Here's my analysis and recommendations:

Key Components You'll Need
Web Interface:

Frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular)

Search forms for usernames/keywords

Results display area

Backend Scraping System:

Server-side language (Node.js, Python, etc.)

Proxy management

Rate limiting handling

Data storage (database or file system)

Browser Integration:

Browser extension to access your logged-in sessions

Cookie management

Technical Approach
Without APIs (Scraping Approach)
Username Search Across Platforms:

Maintain a database of social media URL patterns (e.g., twitter.com/{username})

Programmatically visit each platform with the username

Parse HTML responses for profile information

Keyword Search:

Need to simulate search behavior on each platform

Handle pagination for comprehensive results

Extract posts, comments, likes metadata

Browser Integration:

Develop a browser extension that can:

Access your current sessions/cookies

Perform authenticated requests

Bypass some CAPTCHAs by using your existing session

Challenges to Consider
Anti-Scraping Measures:

Rate limiting (you'll need delays between requests)

CAPTCHAs (even with cookies, some platforms may still challenge)

Dynamic content (many sites use heavy JavaScript)

Legal Considerations:

Terms of Service violations (many platforms prohibit scraping)

Privacy law compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

Maintenance Burden:

Social media sites frequently change their HTML structures

You'll need constant updates to keep the tool working

Implementation Recommendations
Start Small:

Begin with 2-3 major platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)

Expand gradually

Use Existing Libraries:

For Python: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Playwright

For JavaScript: Puppeteer, Cheerio

Browser Extension Approach:

Create a Chrome/Firefox extension that can:

Intercept your browsing sessions

Perform searches in the background

Collect and organize data

Data Organization:

Design a good schema for storing scraped data

Implement visualization for connections between accounts

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this architecture? Or would you prefer a more basic implementation plan to start with?

more basic implementation
Basic Implementation Plan for Web-Based Social Media OSINT Tool
Here's a simplified step-by-step approach to build a minimum viable version of your tool:

1. Set Up Basic Web Interface
html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Social Media OSINT Tool</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Social Media Search</h1>
    
    <form id="usernameForm">
        <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="Enter username">
        <button type="submit">Search Username</button>
    </form>
    
    <form id="keywordForm">
        <input type="text" id="keyword" placeholder="Enter keyword">
        <button type="submit">Search Content</button>
    </form>
    
    <div id="results"></div>
    
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
2. Create Simple Backend (Node.js Example)
javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/search-username', async (req, res) => {
    const { username } = req.body;
    const results = {};
    
    // Twitter check
    results.twitter = await checkPlatform(`https://twitter.com/${username}`);
    
    // Instagram check
    results.instagram = await checkPlatform(`https://instagram.com/${username}`);
    
    res.json(results);
});

async function checkPlatform(url) {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    
    try {
        await page.goto(url);
        await page.waitForTimeout(2000); // Wait for page to load
        
        // Check if profile exists
        const exists = await page.evaluate(() => {
            return !document.body.innerText.includes('Page not found');
        });
        
        await browser.close();
        return exists ? url : 'Not found';
    } catch (error) {
        await browser.close();
        return 'Error checking';
    }
}

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
3. Basic Frontend JavaScript
javascript
// app.js
document.getElementById('usernameForm').addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const username = document.getElementById('username').value;
    
    const response = await fetch('/search-username', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ username })
    });
    
    const results = await response.json();
    displayResults(results);
});

function displayResults(results) {
    const resultsDiv = document.getElementById('results');
    resultsDiv.innerHTML = '';
    
    for (const [platform, result] of Object.entries(results)) {
        const p = document.createElement('p');
        p.innerHTML = `<strong>${platform}:</strong> ${result}`;
        resultsDiv.appendChild(p);
    }
}
4. Run the Basic Tool
Install required packages:

bash
npm init -y
npm install express puppeteer
Start the server:

bash
node server.js
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

5. Next Steps to Improve
Add More Platforms: Expand the checkPlatform() function to include more sites

Add Profile Scraping: Modify to extract profile info when found

Keyword Search: Implement similar function to search posts/comments

Browser Session Integration:

Use Puppeteer with user data directory to maintain your logged-in sessions

javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: false,
    userDataDir: './user_data'
});
Add Simple Storage: Store results in a JSON file or simple database

Important Notes
This basic version will be detected by some platforms if used aggressively

You'll need to manually solve CAPTCHAs when they appear (since you're running with headless: false)

Each platform will need custom selectors to properly scrape data

Would you like me to expand on any particular part of this basic implementation?

give me a prompt i can give to a developer AI to make this tool make it more clear and explain in each of the steps backend and frontend and also it has to be made with python
Here’s a clear and structured prompt you can give to a developer AI (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to build a Python-based web OSINT tool with detailed explanations for each step:

Prompt for AI Developer:
Goal: Build a web-based Python OSINT tool that searches usernames/keywords across social media platforms by scraping (no APIs), using the browser's existing session to avoid detection.

1. Requirements
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS):
A clean interface with two search options:

Username search → Checks if username exists on Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc.

Keyword search → Scrapes posts/comments containing keywords.

Display results in a structured table (Platform, URL, Profile Info, Posts).

Simple loading animation during scraping.

Backend (Python - Flask/Django):
Use Playwright/Selenium (for browser automation with cookies).

Scrape:

Profile data (bio, followers, posts).

Keyword-based content (posts, comments, likes).

Handle CAPTCHAs by pausing for manual solving (since we use real browser sessions).

Rate-limiting (delays between requests to avoid bans).

Browser Integration:
Use existing browser cookies/sessions (Chrome/Firefox profile) to stay logged in.

Headless mode optional (but manual CAPTCHA solving may be needed).

2. Step-by-Step Breakdown
Step 1: Setup Python Backend (Flask)
Install:

bash
pip install flask playwright selenium requests beautifulsoup4
Initialize Flask app:

python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template
app = Flask(__name__)
Explain:

Flask handles HTTP requests.

Playwright/Selenium automates the browser.

BeautifulSoup parses HTML.

Step 2: Scrape Social Media (Example: Twitter)
python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def scrape_twitter(username):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Use existing Chrome session (no login needed)
        browser = p.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
            user_data_dir="./chrome_profile",
            headless=False
        )
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto(f"https://twitter.com/{username}")
        
        # Check if profile exists
        if "Page doesn’t exist" in page.content():
            return {"error": "Profile not found"}
        
        # Extract bio, tweets, etc.
        bio = page.query_selector("div[data-testid='UserDescription']").inner_text()
        tweets = page.query_selector_all("article[data-testid='tweet']")
        
        return {"bio": bio, "tweets": [tweet.inner_text() for tweet in tweets]}
Explanation:

Uses Playwright to open Chrome with existing cookies.

Checks if profile exists, then scrapes data.

Step 3: Frontend (HTML/JS)
html
<!-- templates/index.html -->
<form id="usernameForm">
    <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="e.g., elonmusk">
    <button type="submit">Search Username</button>
</form>

<div id="results">
    <!-- Results populate here -->
</div>

<script>
    document.getElementById("usernameForm").addEventListener("submit", async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const username = document.getElementById("username").value;
        const response = await fetch("/search?username=" + username);
        const data = await response.json();
        displayResults(data);
    });
</script>
Explanation:

Simple form sends username to backend.

Fetches results and displays them.

Step 4: Flask Routes
python
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/search")
def search():
    username = request.args.get("username")
    results = {
        "twitter": scrape_twitter(username),
        # Add Instagram, Reddit, etc.
    }
    return jsonify(results)
Explanation:

/ → Renders the frontend.

/search → Calls scraping functions.

Step 5: Run the App
bash
flask run
3. Additional Features to Request
CAPTCHA Handling: Pause script and prompt user to solve manually.

Rate Limiting: Add delays between requests (time.sleep(2)).

Export Data: Save results as JSON/CSV.

More Platforms: Add Instagram, Reddit, Facebook.

4. Expected Output
A working web app where:

User enters a username/keyword.

Backend scrapes social media.

Results display in a table.

Would you like me to refine any part of this prompt? (e.g., focus on CAPTCHA handling, add more platforms, etc.)

what the tool should do type stuff
Here’s a clear breakdown of what the tool should do, organized by functionality, user flow, and technical behavior:

Core Functionality
1. Username Search
Input: A single username (e.g., elonmusk).

Action:

Scrape profile existence across platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc.).

Extract public data:

Bio/description

Profile picture

Follower/following counts

Recent posts (if public)

Output:

Table with:

Platform	Exists?	Profile URL	Bio Snippet
Twitter	✅	twitter.com/elonmusk	"Technoking of Tesla"
2. Keyword Search
Input: A keyword/phrase (e.g., "AI ethics").

Action:

Search for posts/comments containing the keyword on:

Twitter (tweets)

Reddit (threads/comments)

Instagram (captions)

Scrape metadata:

Post text
